# Allow Root Login SSH Script

This script enables root login in the SSH server configuration by modifying the `sshd_config` file. Please use this script with caution, as allowing root login can have security implications. Ensure that you have strong passwords or consider using key-based authentication instead.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the `allow_root_login.sh` script.

2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is located.

3. Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x allow_root_login.sh
   ```

4. Run the script with root privileges:
   ```bash
   sudo ./allow_root_login.sh
   ```

   You may be prompted to enter your password.

5. The script will make a backup of the original `sshd_config` file, modify it to allow root login, and restart the SSH service.

## Important Note

Enabling root login can increase the risk of unauthorized access. Make sure to take appropriate security measures and follow best practices to protect your system.
